**** basic of FD
    | FD | pointer |
    |----+---------|
    | 0  | stdin   |
    | 1  | stdout  |
    | 2  | stderr  |

    + A File Descriptor (FD) is a number which refers to an open file.
      #+begin_quote
      Each process has its own private set of FDs, but FDs are inherited by child processes from the parent process.
      Every process should inherit three open FDs from its parent: *0 ("standard input")*, open for reading; and *1 ("standard output")* and *2 ("standard error")*, open for writing. A process that is started without one or more of these may behave unpredictably. (So never close stderr. Always redirect to /dev/null instead.)
      #+end_quote

    + FD 3,4, ..., 9 are for additional files, need to be open first before used. For more info see:

**** *EXPANSIONs*: (man bash::"expansion") 7(8?) kinds of expansions. including dollar sign, with or without single/double parenthesis
     #+begin_quote
       The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion.
       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitution. This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution.
       After  these  expansions  are performed, quote characters present in the original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).
       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words  of  the  expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "$@" and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).

             (( tCount++ ))

          echo ${a:=$b}             # 1   # a is null, assign a default value $b to a. Now a === $b.
          a=; echo ${a:?'err'}      # err # a is null | unset, output errMsg to stderr
          a=2; echo ${a:+$b}        # 1   # nothing happens if a is null | unset, else, output $b
          
          a='abcde'; arr=($(seq 1 10));

          echo ${a:2:2}              # 'cd'  # ${param:offset:length}

          # ... a few more syntax with patterns are not included. see man bash::"parameter expansion"
          #+end_src

***** 4. command substitution: ~$(command)~ or ~`command`~
      #+begin_quote
        Bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.
      #+end_quote
        
***** 5. arithmetic expansion: ~$((expression))~: eval the arithmetic expression and substitute the result.
         - ~echo $(((1+1)**(1+2)))~     # 8
         - ~echo $(((1+1) % (1+2)))~    # 2
          
***** 6. process substitution: ~<(list) or >(list)~
      #+begin_quote
        Process substitution allows a process's input or output to be referred to using a filename. It takes the form of <(list) or >(list). *The process list is run asynchronously*, and its input or output appears as  a filename. This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion. If the >(list) form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list. If the <(list) form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of list. Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files. When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       #+begin_quote
         A subshell starts out as an almost identical copy of the original shell process. Under the hood, the shell calls the *fork* system call, which creates a new process whose code and memory are copies. When the subshell is created, there are very few differences between it and its parent. In particular, they have the same variables. Even the $$ special variable keeps the same value in subshells: it's the original shell's process ID. Similarly $PPID is the PID of the parent of the original shell.
         *A subshell created by (…) has the same file descriptors as its creator*. *Some other means of creating subshells modify some file descriptors before executing user code*; for example, the left-hand side of a pipe runs in a subshell3 with standard output connected to the pipe. The subshell also starts out with the same current directory, the same signal mask, etc. ...

** DNS enumeration TODO recursor
   + dns client <-> DNS recursor <-> DNS infrastructure
   + the DNS infrastructure:
     + cliient:
     #+begin_quote
     The process starts when a hostname is entered into a browser or other application. The browser passes the hostname to the operating system’s DNS client and the operating system then forwards the request to the external DNS server it is configured to use. This first server in the chain is known as the DNS recursor and is responsible for interacting with the DNS infrastructure and returning the results to the DNS client. The DNS recursor contacts one of the servers in the DNS root zone.
     #+end_quote
     + step 1:
     #+begin_quote
     The DNS recursor contacts *one of the servers in the DNS root zone*. The root server then *responds with the address of the server responsible for the zone containing the Top Level Domain (TLD)*.
     #+end_quote
     + step 2:
     #+begin_quote
     Once the DNS recursor receives the address of the TLD DNS server, it *queries it for the address of the authoritative nameserver* for the megacorpone.com domain.
     #+end_quote
     + step 3:
     #+begin_quote
     The authoritative nameserver is the final step in the DNS lookup process and contains the DNS records in a local database known as *the zone file*. It *typically hosts two zones for each domain, the forward lookup zone that is used to find the IP address of a specific hostname and the reverse lookup zone (if configured by the
administrator), which is used to find the hostname of a specific IP address*.
     #+end_quote
     + client:
     #+begin_quote
     Once the DNS recursor provides the DNS client with the IP address for www.megacorpone.com, the browser can contact the correct web server at its IP address and load the webpage.
     #+end_quote
     
*** dns caching
    #+begin_quote
    To improve the performance and reliability of DNS, DNS caching is used to store local copies of DNS records at various stages of the lookup process. It is for this reason that some modern applications, such as web browsers, keep a separate DNS cache. In addition, the local DNS client of the operating system also maintains its own DNS cache along with each of the DNS servers in the lookup process. Domain owners can also control how long a server or client caches a DNS record via the Time To Live (TTL) field of a DNS record.
    #+end_quote
    
*** dns records common types
    + NS - Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
    + A - Also known as a host record, the “a record” contains the IP address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
    + MX - Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
    + PTR - Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and are used to find the records associated with an IP address.
    + CNAME - Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
    + TXT - Text records can contain any arbitrary data and can be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.

**** reverse lookup brute force (ip -> hostname, TODO check PTR, p174)
     #+begin_quote
     If the DNS administrator of megacorpone.com configured PTR 191 records for the domain, we could scan the approximate range with reverse lookups to request the hostname for each IP.
     #+end_quote

*** dns zone transfers (enum possible AAA records within the zone)
    + info:
      - the RFC 5936 *Authoritative Transfer (AXFR)* protocol
      - an automation script in PWK p176
    #+begin_quote
    A zone transfer is basically a database replication between related DNS servers in which the zone file is copied from a master DNS server to a slave server. The zone file contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone. Zone transfers should only be allowed to authorized slave DNS servers but many administrators misconfigure their DNS servers, and in these cases, anyone asking for a copy of the DNS server zone will usually receive one.

*** scanning for the NetBIOS service
    + about NetBIOS:
      #+begin_quote
The NetBIOS service listens on TCP port 139 as well as several UDP ports. It should be noted that SMB (TCP port 445) and NetBIOS are two separate protocols. NetBIOS is an independent session layer protocol and service that allows computers on a local network to communicate with each other. While modern implementations of SMB can work without NetBIOS, NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) is required for backward compatibility and is often enabled together. For this reason, the enumeration of these two services often goes hand-in-hand. These can be scanned with tools like nmap, using syntax similar to the following:
      #+end_quote

    + src: 
      - with nmap:
      #+begin_src sh

** NFS enumeration
   + about NFS:
   #+begin_quote
    Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. It allows a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network as if they were on locally-mounted storage.
    NFS is often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its implementation. It can be somewhat difficult to set up securely, so it’s not uncommon to find NFS shares open to the world. This is quite convenient for us as penetration testers, as we might be able to leverage them to collect sensitive information, escalate our privileges, and so forth.
   #+end_quote
   
*** scanning for NFS shares p197
    + the TCP port 111
    #+begin_quote
    Both *Portmapper* and *RPCbind* run on TCP port 111. RPCbind maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve.
    The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The
rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number (often TCP port 2049) so it can communicate with the requested service. We can scan these ports with nmap using the following syntax:
      #+end_quote
    + src:
      #+begin_src sh
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254

We can also gather information about a host or network from vulnerable mail servers. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) supports several interesting commands, such as VRFY and EXPN. A VRFY request asks the server to verify an email address, while EXPN asks the server for the membership of a mailing list. These can often be abused to verify existing users on a mail server, which is useful information during a penetration test.

** SNMP enumeration : Simple Network Management Protocol : UDP 161
   + about SNMP
   #+begin_quote
   Over the years, we have often found that the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is not well-understood by many network administrators. This often results in SNMP misconfigurations, which can result in significant information leakage.

   SNMP is based on UDP, a simple, stateless protocol, and is therefore susceptible to IP spoofing and replay attacks. In addition, the commonly used SNMP protocols 1, 2, and 2c offer no traffic encryption, meaning that SNMP information and credentials can be easily intercepted over a local network. Traditional SNMP protocols also have weak authentication schemes and are commonly left configured with default public and private community strings.

    #+begin_quote
The SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) is a database containing information usually related to network management. The database is organized like a tree, where branches represent different organizations or network functions. The leaves of the tree (final endpoints) correspond to specific variable values that can then be accessed, and probed, by an external user.

** Vulnerability Scanning Overview and Considerations
   
*** How Vulnerability Scanners Work
    1. Detect if a target is up and running.
    2. Conduct a full or partial port scan, depending on the configuration.
    3. Identify the operating system using common fingerprinting techniques.
    4. Attempt to identify running services with common techniques such as banner grabbing, service behavior identification, or file discovery.
    5. Execute a *signature-matching process* to discover vulnerabilities.
    #+begin_quote
    As a part of this signature-matching process, many scanners use banner grabbing, a simple technique where text strings generated during an initial interaction with an application are obtained and analyzed. Some applications generate very specific banners, such as OpenSSH, which may return “SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10”, allowing us to precisely pinpoint the application version, while others, such as Apache Tomcat versions 4.1.x to 8.0.x, return a generic HTTP header of “Apache-Coyote/1.1”. 

    Most automated scanners inspect a wide variety of other target information during the signature-matching process. Nevertheless, even a strong signature match does not guarantee the presence of a vulnerability. This means automated scanners can generate quite a few false positives and by contrast, false negatives, in which a vulnerability is overlooked because of a signature mismatch. False positives and negatives can also occur because of backporting, in which package maintainers "roll back" software security patches to older versions. Backporting may result in the scanner flagging software as a vulnerable version when the vulnerability has actually been repaired.
    #+end_quote
    
*** know the target
    + the traffic volume. Throttle scan speed && use timeout at first, increace speed till reaching quality-speed balance.
    + network position.
      #+begin_quote
      Finally, our network positioning can affect target visibility. For example, a typical vulnerability scanner will attempt to discover targets with a ping sweep or ARP scan.224 However, Internet connected targets would not be able to receive ARP traffic from external subnets and may block ICMP (ping) requests,225 meaning the scanner could miss the targets entirely if it has been configured to rely solely on these discovery options.
      #+end_quote
    
*** authenticated vs unauthenticated scanning
    
**** authenticated scan
     #+begin_quote
     Authenticated scans generate a wealth of additional information and produce more accurate results at the expense of a longer scan time. Although an authenticated scan can be used during a penetration test (using discovered credentials, for example), it is more commonly used during the patch management process.

        + firewall settings
      #+begin_quote
      ...once access is properly configured, most scanners analyze the *system configuration, registry settings, and application and system patch levels*. They also review *files in the Program Files directories* as well as *all supporting executables and DLLs in the Windows folder*, all in an attempt to detect potentially vulnerable software.

** Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
   #+begin_quote
   ...a popular vulnerability scanner that supports a staggering 130,000 plugins228 (vulnerability checks) at the time of this writing. While originally developed as an open source application, in 2005 the source was closed. The change to a closed source model resulted in forks of the open source project, and to the release of OpenVAS. There are many commercial and open source vulnerability scanners with various strengths and weaknesses.
   However, Nessus is a quite capable industry standard, and the free “Essentials” version allows us to scan up to 16 IPs. It gives us insight into how to use the full commercial version without time limits or other constraints. The overall concepts discussed in this section will generally apply to just about any other commercial scanner as well.

   + ~p236
     
** Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap : NSE
   #+begin_quote
   As an alternative to Nessus, we can also use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to perform automated vulnerability scans. While NSE is not a full-fledged vulnerability scanner, it does have a respectable library of scripts that can be used to detect and validate vulnerabilities. NSE scripts are written in Lua and range in functionality from brute force and authentication to detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities. For these purposes we will focus on the scripts in the “vuln” and “exploit” categories, as the former detects a vulnerability and the latter attempts to exploit it.
   However, there is overlap between these categories and some “vuln” scripts may essentially run stripped-down exploits. For this reason, scripts are also further categorized as “safe” or “intrusive” and we should take great care when executing the latter because they may crash a remote service or take down the target.

    #+begin_quote
    Active Directory consists of several components. The most important component is the domain controller (DC), which is *a Windows 2000-2019 server with the Active Directory Domain Services role installed*. The domain controller is the hub and core of Active Directory because it stores all information about how the specific instance of Active Directory is configured. It also enforces a vast variety of rules that govern how objects within a given Windows domain interact with each other, and what services and tools are available to end users.

    #+begin_quote
    System administrators can (and almost always do) organize these objects with the help of Organizational Units (OU). OUs are comparable to file system folders in that they are containers used to store and group other objects. Computer objects represent actual servers and workstations that are domain-joined (part of the domain), and user objects represent employees in the organization. All AD objects contain attributes, which vary according to the type of object. For example, a user object may include attributes such as first name, last name, username, and password.

    + info:
 [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/197132/active-directory-fsmo-roles-in-windows]]
    #+begin_quote
    Active Directory is the central repository in which all objects in an enterprise and their respective attributes are stored. It is a hierarchical, multi-master enabled database, capable of storing millions of objects. Because it is multi-master, changes to the database can be processed at any given domain controller (DC) in the enterprise regardless of whether the DC is connected or disconnected from the network.
    #+end_quote
    + AD is *multi-master enabled* database. This model allows the flexibility that change could occur at any Domain Controller(DC) in the enterprise. However, this model could also possibility leads to conflicts(under race condition). To resolve this problem, AD use algorithm e.g. last writer wins. Or, to prevent the conflict use *Single-master model* in some cases.
    #+begin_quote
    To prevent conflicting updates in Windows, the Active Directory performs updates to certain objects in a single-master fashion. In a single-master model, only one DC in the entire directory is allowed to process updates. This is similar to the role given to a primary domain controller (PDC) in earlier versions of Windows (such as Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0), in which the PDC is responsible for processing all updates in a given domain.

    Active Directory extends the single-master model found in earlier versions of Windows to include multiple roles, and the ability to transfer roles to any DC in the enterprise. Because an Active Directory role is not bound to a single DC, it is referred to as an FSMO role. Currently in Windows there are five FSMO roles:

    1. *Schema Master* - (one per forest?).
       + The schema master FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for performing updates to the directory schema (that is, the schema naming context or LDAP://cn=schema,cn=configuration,dc=<domain>). This DC is the only one that can process updates to the *directory schema*. Once the Schema update is complete, it is replicated from the schema master to all other DCs in the directory. There is only one schema master per directory.

    2. *Domain Naming Master* - (one per forest?).
       + The domain naming master FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for making changes to the forest-wide domain name space of the directory (that is, the Partitions\Configuration naming context or LDAP://CN=Partitions, CN=Configuration, DC=<domain>). This DC is the only one that can add or remove a domain from the directory. It can also add or remove cross references to domains in external directories.

    3. *Relative ID (RID) Master* - (one per domain?).
       + The RID master FSMO role holder is the single DC responsible for processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within a given domain. It is also responsible for removing an object from its domain and putting it in another domain during an object move.
       + When a DC creates a security principal object such as a user or group, it attaches a unique Security ID (SID) to the object. This SID consists of a domain SID (the same for all SIDs created in a domain), and a relative ID (RID) that is unique for each security principal SID created in a domain.
       + Each Windows DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it is allowed to assign to the security principals it creates. When a DC's allocated RID pool falls below a threshold, that DC issues a request for additional RIDs to the domain's RID master. The domain RID master responds to the request by retrieving RIDs from the domain's unallocated RID pool and assigns them to the pool of the requesting DC. There is one RID master per domain in a directory.

    4. *Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator* - (one per domain?).
       + The PDC emulator is necessary to synchronize time in an enterprise. Windows includes the W32Time (Windows Time) time service that is required by the Kerberos authentication protocol. All Windows-based computers within an enterprise use a common time. The purpose of the time service is to ensure that the Windows Time service uses a hierarchical relationship that controls authority and does not permit loops to ensure appropriate common time usage.
       + The PDC emulator of a domain is authoritative for the domain. The PDC emulator at the root of the forest becomes authoritative for the enterprise, and should be configured to gather the time from an external source. All PDC FSMO role holders follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their in-bound time partner.
       + In a Windows domain, the PDC emulator role holder retains the following functions:
         - Password changes performed by other DCs in the domain are replicated preferentially to the PDC emulator.
         - Authentication failures that occur at a given DC in a domain because of an incorrect password are forwarded to the PDC emulator before a bad password failure message is reported to the user.
         - Account lockout is processed on the PDC emulator.
         - The PDC emulator performs all of the functionality that a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server-based PDC or earlier PDC performs for Windows NT 4.0-based or earlier clients.
       + ... (changelogs for pre-Windows 2000 system)

    5. *Infrastructure Master* - (one per domain?).
       + When an object in one domain is referenced by another object in another domain, it represents the reference by:
         - The GUID
         - The SID (for references to security principals)
         - The DN of the object being referenced

       + The infrastructure FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for updating an object's SID and distinguished name in a cross-domain object reference.

*** Enumeration Through Service Principal Names (the service accounts)
    + info:
    #+begin_quote
    [...]
    An alternative to attacking a domain user account is to target so-called service accounts, which may also be members of high value groups.
    When an application is executed, it must always do so in the context of an operating system user.
    If a user launches an application, that user account defines the context. However, services launched by the system itself use the context based on a Service Account.
    In other words, isolated applications can use a set of predefined service accounts: *LocalSystem*, *LocalService*, and *NetworkService*.
    For more complex applications, a domain user account may be used to provide the needed context while still having access to resources inside the domain.
    When applications like Exchange, SQL, or Internet Information Services (IIS) are integrated into Active Directory, a unique service instance identifier known as a *Service Principal Name (SPN)*  is used to associate a service on a specific server to a service account in Active Directory.
    [...]
    #+end_quote
    #+begin_quote
*Managed Service Accounts*, introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2, were designed for complex applications which require tighter integration with Active Directory. Larger applications like SQL and Microsoft Exchange often require server redundancy when running to guarantee availability, but Managed Service Accounts cannot support this. To remedy this, *Group Managed Service Accounts* were introduced with Windows Server 2012, but this requires that domain controllers run Windows Server 2012 or higher. Because of this, many organizations still rely on basic Service Accounts.
    #+end_quote
    + Aim: 
    #+begin_quote

**  Active Directory Authentication

*** NTLM Authentication
    #+begin_quote
    NTLM authentication is used when a client authenticates to a server by IP address (instead of by hostname), or if the user attempts to authenticate to a hostname that is not registered on the Active Directory integrated DNS server. Likewise, third-party applications may choose to use NTLM authentication instead of Kerberos authentication. 
    #+end_quote
    + steps(a client login to an application server):
      - 1. client *calculate NTLM hash from the user's password*;
      - 2. client computer *send the username* to the application server;
      - 3. application server replies a random value called the *nonce* or *challenge* back to the client;
      - 4. client *encrypts the nonce using the NTLM hash*, as *response* and send it back to the application server.
      - 5. application server forwards the *response*, the *username*, and the *nonce* to the DC;
      - 6. DC encrypt the nonce again, with the user's NTLM hash and compare the result with the *response*, approve the authentication request if the comparison returns equal. DC knows all users' NTLM hash.

    + hence pass-the-hash is possible knowing NTLM hash.

  + the basic: 
  #+begin_quote
  The basic Kerberos authentication process proceeds as follows: A client sends a request to the authentication server (AS) for "credentials" for a given server. *The AS responds with these credentials, encrypted in the client's key. The credentials consist of a "ticket" for the server and a temporary encryption key (often called a "session key").* The client *transmits the ticket (which contains the client's identity and a copy of the session key, all encrypted in the server's key) to the server.* The session key (now shared by the client and server) is used to authenticate the client and may optionally be used to authenticate the server. It may also be used to encrypt further communication between the two parties or to exchange a separate sub-session key to be used to encrypt further communication.
  #+end_quote

  + vectors 0:
  #+begin_quote
  Implementation of the basic protocol consists of one or more authentication servers running on *physically secure* hosts.
  #+end_quote

  + vectors 1:
  #+begin_quote
  There are two basic methods by which a client can ask a Kerberos server for credentials. In the first approach, the client sends a *cleartext request* for a ticket for the desired server to the AS. The reply is sent encrypted in the client's secret key. Usually this request is for a ticket-granting ticket (TGT), which can later be used with the ticket-granting server (TGS). In the second method, the client sends a request to the TGS. The client uses the TGT to authenticate itself to the TGS in the same manner as if it were contacting any other application server that requires Kerberos authentication. The reply is encrypted in the session key from the TGT. Though the protocol specification describes the AS and the TGS as separate servers, in practice they are implemented as different protocol entry points within a single Kerberos server.
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_quote
  To verify the identities of the principals in a transaction, the client transmits the ticket to the application server. Because the ticket is sent "in the clear" (parts of it are encrypted, but this encryption doesn't thwart replay) and might be intercepted and reused by an attacker, additional information is sent to prove that the message originated with the principal to whom the ticket was issued. This information (called *the authenticator) is encrypted in the session key and includes a timestamp.* The timestamp proves that the message was recently generated and is not a replay. Encrypting the authenticator in the session key proves that it was generated by a party possessing the session key. Since no one except the requesting principal and the server know the session key (it is never sent over the network in the clear), this guarantees the identity of the client.
  The integrity of the messages exchanged between principals can also be guaranteed by using the session key *(passed in the ticket and contained in the credentials).* This approach provides detection of both replay attacks and message stream modification attacks.

**** steps: The Authentication Service (AS) Exchange (RFC 4120::3.1) (user get the TGT)

  |--------------------+-------------------------|
  | client to Kerberos | KRB_AS_REQ              |
  | Kerberos to client | KRB_AS_REP or KRB_ERROR |

  #+begin_quote
  The Authentication Service (AS) Exchange between the client and the Kerberos Authentication Server is initiated by a client when it wishes to obtain authentication credentials for a given server but currently holds no credentials.
  #+end_quote 
    - 1. user login to workstation: user send *[KRB_]AS_REQ* ((Kerberos) Authentication Service Request) which contains username and a encrypted timestamp. The timestamp is encrypted using a *hmac* (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) derived from the user's password, to the *KDC* . For the hmac, see the docs section above, some older version use *rc4_hmac_nt* which is NTLM/md4 hash.
[[./img/b3cp21_KerberosPreAuth.png]]
    - 2. the *KDC*, also knows the *hmac*, will validate the authentication if it can decrypt the timestamp with the *hmac*. If auth success, a *TGT* (Ticket Granting Ticket) representing the user in the domain for a specified period, will be issued and send back in the *[KRB_]AS_REP* to the client. The KDC considers the client auth complete once the client has received the session key and the *TGT*.

      + "This *TGT* is encrypted with a key(the *hmac* of the *krbtgt* account) shared between all KDC", "The *TGT* contains information regarding the user, including group memberships, the domain, a time stamp, the IP address of the client, and the session key."

[[./img/b3cp21_KerberosTGT.png]]
      + the *[KRB_]AS_REP* also contains a session key(i.e. two copies, one in the AS_REP, another sealed in the TGT) since Kerberos is stateless. the session key is encrypted using the user's *hmac* .
      #+begin_quote RFC4120 3.1.
      The response, *KRB_AS_REP* , contains a ticket for the client to present to the server, and a session key that will be shared by the client and the server. The session key and additional information are encrypted in the client's secret key.
      #+end_quote

      + The *TGT* will be valid for 10 hours by default, after that a renewal occurs. "This renewal does not require the user to re-enter the password."

    - the ticket is ASN.1 encoded? tool::OpenSSL
    
**** steps: The Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) Exchange (user get a TGS)

  | Message direction  | Message type             |
  |--------------------+--------------------------|
  | client to Kerberos | KRB_TGS_REQ              |
  | Kerberos to client | KRB_TGS_REP or KRB_ERROR |

  + TGS Exchange, the overview:
  #+begin_quote
  The TGS exchange between a client and the Kerberos TGS is *initiated by a client* when it seeks to obtain authentication credentials for a given server (which might be registered in a remote realm), when it seeks to renew or validate an existing ticket, or when it seeks to obtain a proxy ticket. In the first case, the client must already have acquired a ticket for the Ticket-Granting Service using the AS exchange (the TGT is usually obtained when a client initially authenticates to the system, such as when a user logs in).
  
  The message format for the TGS exchange is almost identical to that for the AS exchange.  The primary difference is that *encryption and decryption* in the TGS exchange does not take place under the client's key. Instead, *the session key from the TGT or renewable ticket,* or sub-session key from an Authenticator is used.  As is the case for all application servers, expired tickets are not accepted by the TGS, so once a renewable or TGT expires, the client must use a separate exchange to obtain valid tickets. (RFC 4120::3.3)
  #+end_quote

  + TGS Exchange, client side:
    - user wishes to access resources of the domain (e.g. something with a registered *SPN*): client constructs a *KRB_TGS_REQ* (Ticket Granting Service Request) packet "that consists of *the current user* and a *timestamp (encrypted using the session key),*  *the SPN of the resource,* and *the encrypted TGT.*" (and the session key)
    #+begin_quote
    The client prepares the KRB_TGS_REQ message, providing an authentication header as an element of the padata field, and including the same fields as used in the KRB_AS_REQ message along with several optional fields: the enc-authorizatfion-data field for application server use and additional tickets required by some options. ( RFC4120 3.3.1. Generation of KRB_TGS_REQ Message)
    #+end_quote

  + TGS Exchange, server side, additional checks
    - First, the Kerberos server will determine which key should be used to decrypt the TGT. (if the SPN exists in this domain then use the TGS's key, if the TGT was issued by another realm then use inter-realm key.)
      #+begin_quote
      (...), the ticket granting service on the KDC receives the TGS_REQ, and if the SPN exists in the domain, the TGT is decrypted using the secret key known only to the KDC. (PWK p646)
      #+end_quote
    - Next, the session key is extracted from the TGT, and used to decrypt other info in the TGS_REQ, and perform several checks.
      #+begin_quote
      The session key is then extracted from the TGT and used to decrypt the username and timestamp of the request. As this point the KDC performs several checks:
      1. The TGT must have a valid timestamp (no replay detected and the request has not expired).
      2. The username from the TGS_REQ has to match the username from the TGT.
      3. The client IP address needs to coincide with the TGT IP address. (PWK p646)
      #+end_quote

    - If valid, server send the *TGS_REP*
      #+begin_quote
      (...) ( the *TGS_REP* ) packet contains three parts:
      1. The SPN to which access has been granted.
      2. A session key to be used between the client and the SPN.
      3. A service ticket containing the username and group memberships along with the newly-created session key. 

      The first two parts (SPN and session key) are encrypted *using the session key associated with the creation of the TGT* and the service ticket is encrypted using *the password hash of the service account registered with the SPN* in question.
      #+end_quote

    - When the TGS Exchange is complete, the client should have both a session key and a service ticket. Then the service authentication begins.

**** steps: The Client/Server (CS) Authentication Exchange (RFC4120::3.2) (user use a TGS)

| Message direction              | Message type            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Client to Application server   | KRB_AP_REQ              |
| [optional] Ap server to Client | KRB_AP_REP or KRB_ERROR |

    - CS Exchange Overview:
      #+begin_quote
      The client/server authentication (CS) exchange is used by network applications to authenticate the client to the server and vice versa. The client MUST have already acquired credentials for the server using the AS or TGS exchange. (RFC4120::3.2)
      #+end_quote
  
    - Client need to obtain the service ticket from some source, before initiating a CS Exchange:
      #+begin_quote 
      the client "obtains (either through a credentials cache, the AS exchange, or the TGS exchange) a ticket and session key for the desired service." (RFC4120::3.2.2.)
      #+end_quote
  
    - General Flow:
      #+begin_quote
      Passing these checks provides only authentication of the named principal; it does not imply authorization to use the named service. Applications MUST make a separate authorization decision based upon the authenticated name of the user, the requested operation, local access control information such as that contained in a .k5login or .k5users file, and possibly a separate distributed authorization service. (RFC4120::3.2.3.)

      First, the client sends to the application server an application request or *AP_REQ* , which includes *the username and a timestamp encrypted with the session key associated with the service ticket along with the service ticket itself.* (note: the session key in the TGS_REP)
  
      The application server *decrypts the service ticket using the(note: its) service account password hash* and extracts the username and the session key. It then *uses the latter to decrypt the username from the AP_REQ.* If the AP_REQ username matches the one decrypted from the service ticket, the request is accepted. Before access is granted, the service inspects the supplied group memberships in the service ticket and assigns appropriate permissions to the user, after which the user may access the requested service.

    - Target::the Cached Credentials
      #+begin_quote
      Since Microsoft’s implementation of Kerberos makes use of single sign-on, password hashes must be stored somewhere in order to renew a TGT request. In current versions of Windows, these hashes are stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory space. 

      If we gain access to these hashes, we could crack them to obtain the cleartext password or reuse them to perform various actions. (PWK)
      #+end_quote 
    
    - Problems:
      + need SYSTEM(local administrator) privilege, since LSASS runs as SYSTEM.
      + the LSASS data is encrypted with an LSASS-store key.
      + the in-memory data structures used by LSASS is not publicly documented.

    - Hence, tools created to tackle the problem and extract the hashes.

      - [[https://adsecurity.org/?p=2293][Cracking Kerberos TGS Tickets Using Kerberoast – Exploiting Kerberos to Compromise the Active Directory Domain]]

    + info:
      - Since Kerberos TGS exchange only check a user's "authenticity" but not "authority", knowing the SPN, any user could request could request a service ticket from the DC, extract it from the local memory and save it to the disk. Then service account password could be cracked.
      #+begin_quote
      The reason why this attack is successful is that most service account passwords are the same length as the domain password minimum (often 10 or 12 characters long) meaning that even brute force cracking doesn’t likely take longer than the password maximum password age (expiration). Most service accounts don’t have passwords set to expire, so it’s likely the same password will be in effect for months if not years.

  + info:
  #+begin_quote
  ## windows/shell_reverse_tcp - Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell
  ## windows/shell/reverse_tcp - Connect back to attacker, Spawn cmd shell (staged)
  [ the "/" means *staged* ]

  + a *non-staged* payload is sent in its entirety along with the exploit.
  + a *staged* payload is usually sent in two parts. The first part contains a small primary payload that causes the victim machine to connect back to the attacker, transfer a larger secondary payload containing the rest of the shellcode, and then execute it. 
(PWK p692)
  #+end_quote
  + use staged when:
    - when payload size is limited.
    - to avoid detection (embedded shell code might be sensitive).

*** Meterpreter Payloads (the MSF spec. the under-the-hood mechanism of the MSF)
  + ref:
    - [[https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter][Meterpreter]]
    - [[http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/meterpreter.pdf][the original Meterpreter specification(internal)]]
  + info (the limitation of the "common command interpreter", e.g. /bin/sh): 
    - executing /bin/sh on the target machine superseding the existing task is "already an red flag action for most applications", and might trigger Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS) on both Windows and Linux(Meterpreter specification p6).
    - /bin/sh maybe not be accessible, if a daemon was running in "chrooted environment". File system above the pseudo-rood directory is usually not accessible without special techniques.
    - the commands accessible on the particular machine is also limited (permitted or not, installed or not).
  + Meterpreter's solution to those problems:
    - it can avoid the creation of a new process "because it executes in the context of the process that is exploited."
    - "executed entirely from memory" using Remote Library Injection
    - "Server extension can be written in any language that can have code distributed as a shared object(DLL) form."
    - it also provides a default set of command with various of utilities.
      + Fs     ## uploading/downloading
      + Net    ## similar to SSH, allows dynamic port forwarding
    - meterpreter's packets allow custom cipher.

** a brief history
   + initially devices exchange info through a common communication controller 
     - ~network node -> communication controller -> network node~
   + with TCP/IP, devices could function as a network end-point

** TCP/IP architecture
   #+begin_quote
   TCP/IP is a collection of of protocols that range from application-specific functions like web
browsing down to the low-level networking protocols like IP and TCP.
   #+end_quote

*** OSI reference model 
    + presentation
      - other detailed transmission utility service that applications may or may not use. e.g., data-compression.
      - since it is better to have a dedicated session layer that purely manage sesions, hence separate the optional services into the presentation layer.
    + session
      - responsible for establishing, and later destroying connections between systems, applications, or users. It may receive the request from any higher layer, and then negotiate a connection using the lower layers. Once a connection is established, the layer simply provides an interface for the higher layers to communicate with.
    + transport
      - may provide reliability services usually lacking from the network layer, for basic transmission services.
    + network
      - identify the addresses of systems on the network, and the actual transmission of data between the systems.
      - must be aware of the physical nature of the network, and package the information in a format that can be further transmitted by the data-link layer.
    + data-link
      - must deal with possible physical layer error, either attempting to retransmit or report the failure to the network layer.  
    + physical
      - strict standards for the wiring systems, specifying e.g., voltage, impedance, etc.

*** TCP/IP basic
    + IP <-> OSI-network-layer
    + TCP or UDP <-> OSI-transport-layer, manage connections.
      - the session management is handled by TCP in browsing.
      - TCP/IP does not provide a formal presentation layer service(e.g. data compression) that an application *must* use, but do provide a few presentation layer service(IBM's NetBIOS, Sun's XDR) that an application *may* use.
    + ? data-link layer
      - data-link protocols are specific to wire, e.g. voltage, 
      - Media Access Control(MAC)
      - Data-Link Connection Identifier(DLCI)
        
**** Data-Link Services
     + implemented by each physical network, the implemetation might different depending on the physical medium. IP datagram is translated to a format that can be understand and delivered in the physical layer.
       
**** the Internet
     + on each local network, data-link or physical level:
       #+begin_quote
       When an IP-enabled device wants to send data to another IP node, the data-link services on that device convert the IP datagrams into a format usable by the local network medium, and then send the data to the destination system using the addressing and framing mechanisms *dictated by the network*.
       #+end_quote
     + Also, IP assume data packets are unreliable and would get lost.

**** the address resolution protocol(ARP)
     + two IP devices must locate each other's hardware addresses before any data exchange. An protocol applicapable to all physical network topology is needed.
     + ARP(who is .40?) -> Response with Hardware Address(I am .40)
      
**** the Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP)
     + ICMP relies on IP, deliver control message backward.
     + ICMP error message are only sent when there is a detectable problem that is preventing certain packets or datagrams from being delivere due to a specific reason. It indicates that the esnding host should probably stop trying to sent those kinds of datagrams to this specific destination system, or that a different path should be used. 

**** IP datagrams vs. IP packets
     + IP datagram is a more abstract concept, while packets are what been sent in data-link layer:
       #+begin_quote
       IP datagrams get sent as IP packets, which are used to relay the IP data- grams to the destination system, one hop at a time. Although in many cases an IP datagram and an IP packet will be exactly the same, they are conceptually different entities.
       IP datagrams contain whatever data is being sent (and the associated IP headers), while IP packets are used to get the datagram to the destination system (as specified in the IP headers).
       #+end_quote

     + i.e., say: src -> router -> dst, then: src send datagrams to dst, while src send packets to router, in those packets contains datagrams.
       #+begin_quote
       These IP packets are sent using the framing mechanisms defined for the specific network medium in use on the local network, and are sub-ject to network events such as fragmentation or loss. However, the datagram itself will always remain as the original piece of data that was sent by the original sender, regardless of anything that happens to any of the packets that are used to
relay the datagram.
       #+end_quote
     + for example, a 4kb datagram being sent might be too big to fit in a simple frame for transmition in a dial-up access network, hence, the datagram might be split into four IP packets, each of which are sent as individual entities in individual frames. Then on the destination system, once all of the IP packets are received, into the original datagram they will be reassembled and processed.

**** ? nested package and header structure
     + wireshark, 
     + how is segment marked in data-link layer
     + header + data, in each layer.
       
**** ? local loopback network 
     
**** ? routing table, specify router for each destination network.
     + popular protocol popular for private networks
       - Routing Information Protocal(RIP)
       - Open Shrortest Path First(OSPF)
     + those dynamic routing protocols tends to consume a lot of CPU cycles, hence are often ran on routers instead of the host
       - set destination 0.0.0.0 <= default router(e.g., 192.168.100.100), on system boot using protocol such as BOOTP or DHCP, or protocol called Router Discorery 
          
**** ? Route aggregation Q: super route, how to separate local vs internet
     + the routing table method cost lots of resources, is not applicable to Internet.
     + address assignment scheme, separate by physical location, leave routing to ISP, only a few(50,000 routes) super-routes need to be suggested. 

**** datagram independence
     + IP networks treat every individual IP datagram as an independent entity, which means they might take whatever path that the router deems fit when forwarding the datagram.

**** datagram/packet intergrity
     + a *packet* will always be inspected when it arrives a system(including a router) along the delivery path. If corruption or any transient errors is detected, the packet will be destroyed immediately. If a semi-permanent problem, e.g., no rounting table entry for the next destination network is found, is dectected, the IP may also use the Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to return the error message back to the original sender.
     + ? header checksum: Q: on each packet or each datagram?

**** header checksums(the checksum *for the IP header* in the IP header)
     + in every package header, for the header itself, not for the body
     #+begin_quote
     Every device that receives an IP datagram must examine the IP header and compare that information with the value stored in the header's checksum field.
     The data portion ... is not verified, for three reasons:
     #+end_quote
       1. for efficiency.
       2. the data portion always consists of a higher-level datagram, e.g., TCP/UDP. Since those portocol might also provide error-checking routines, the data portions might be examed later anyway.
       3. not all but some high level applications might be able to work with corrupted data, discard those then might be disservice
          
**** time-to-live
     + the time-to-live field in the IP header.
       #+begin_quote
       Every system that forwards the packet decreases the value of the Time-to-Live field by one, before sending the datagram on. If the Time-To-Live value reaches zero before the datagram gets to its final destination, then the gacket is destroyed.
       The purpose of the Time-to-Live field is to keep datagrams that are caught in an undeliverable loop from tying up network resources. ... This safeguard prevents routing loops from causing network meltdowns.
       ...
       The strict definition of the Time-to-Live field states that the value is a measure of time in seconds, or any forwarding act that took less than one second to perform. However, there are very few Internet routers that require a full second to perform forwarding, so this definition is somewhat misrepresentative. In actual practice, the Time-to-Live value is decremented for every hop, regardless of the actual time required to forward a datagram from one network segment to another.
       #+end_quote
       
     + the default
       #+begin_quote
       The default value for the Time-to-Live field should be set to 64 according to the Assigned Numbers registry([[http://www.iana.org/][IANA]]). In addition, some of the higher-layer protocols also have default Time-to-Live values that they are supposed to use(e.g., 64 for TCP, and 1 for IGMP). These values are really only suggestions, ... .
       #+end_quote
       
**** fragmentation and reassembly
     + Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU): the maximum bytes in a single frame.
       #+begin_quote
       Ethernet can pass only 1500 bytes in a single frame, while the typical MTU for 16-Mb/s Token Ring is 17,914 bytes per frame.
       RFC 791 specifies that the maximum allowed MTU size is 65,535 bytes, and that the minimum allowed MTU size is 68 bytes. 
       #+end_quote
     + if datagram > maximum 8 byte alignment to MTU, need to be fragmentated. For example, a 4464-byte datagram(20 bytes header + 4444 bytes data) senting to a network where MTU = 1500, will be fragmented to (20 bytes header + 1480 data)*3 + (20 bytes header + 4 bytes data)*1.
     + in the header:
       - 16-bit Fragment Identifier(like a very short uuid), same for all fragments of a datagram.
       - the Fragmentation Offset, counting by the No.s of 8 bytes blocks.
       - 3-bit Flags field: Reserved(must be marked 0), (the packet) May be further Fragmented Flag(0 if possible), More Fragments(0 if no more)
     + the IP software find the first packet whose fragment offset field is 0, and find the last packet whose More Fragments flag is 0, and assemble the rest in order, once all of the segments arrives.
       
**** prioritization and service-based routing
     + 8-bit type of service(TOS) field, or the TOS byte
       - 3-bit(0-7) precedence field marking prioritization (8 levels of prioritization)
         | Precedence | Definition           |
         |------------+----------------------|

       - 4-bit(0-15) the Type-of-Service value predefined by IANA, in RFC 1349.
         | Value | Service               |                        |
         |-------+-----------------------+------------------------|

         |     2 | Maximize Realiability |                        |
         |     4 | Maximize Throughput   | 1 for high throughput  |
         |     8 | Minimize Delay        | 1 for low delay        |
         |    15 | Maximize Security     | RFC 1455, experimental |

       - the IANA also published suggested TOS values for common application protocols.
         
     + there values are more respected in unix/linux environment.

     + in conjunction with TOS-aware router, it is possible to provide deterministic routing service across the managed network, provide different routing depending on the needs of each packet.

*** the IP Header
    #+begin_quote

**** possible routing problem and debugging
    1. the pinciple: 
      - ip devices try to connect each other directly whenever possible, and use route when direct connection is not possible.
      #+begin_quote
      Since IP is designed as a node-centric networking protocol, every device has equal access to the network. In this model, any device can communicate with any other device directly, without requiring the services of a centralized host. Nodes do not send traffic to a central host for processing and relay services, but instead communicate directly with the destination system, if possible.

      When this is not possible—such as when the two hosts are on separate networks—then the sending device has to locate another device to relay the traffic to the destination system on its behalf. Even in this situation the sending device is still self-deterministic, since it chooses which local device it will send the datagrams to for forwarding.

      The process of choosing an intermediate forwarding device is called routing. Whenever a device needs to choose a forwarder, it looks at a local list of available networks and forwarders (called the “routing table”), and decides which interface and forwarder is the most appropriate for the specific datagram that needs to be sent.

      - fragmentation problem might be detected by sending large size ICMP datagram using ping.
     
      - use the ICMP protocol to debug, since almost all problems are related with delivery difficulties.
        #+begin_quote
        Since IP provides only simple delivery services, almost all of the problems with IP are related to delivery difficulties. Perhaps a network segment is down, or a router has been misconfigured, or a host is no longer accepting packets.

        In order to effectively debug problems with IP delivery, you should rely on the ICMP protocol. It is the function of ICMP to report on problems that will keep IP datagrams from getting delivered to their destination effectively.

       #+begin_quote
       Since IP packets are sent inside of media-specific frames, there can be problems with some network media that will manifest when used with IP packets. For example, some network managers have reported problems with network infrastructure equipment such as Ethernet hubs and switches that have problems dealing with full-sized (1500-byte) packets. In those situations, you will need to use ICMP to probe the network for delivery problems through equipment that is acting suspicious.

**** ?Q: ARP and peers on an VPN
     + ?(lack reference)dial-up vs VPN:
       - dial-up use telephone line, but I think they share a similar topology(packet switching), i.e. client-server-Internet
       - while all IP devices are treated as independence entities, both dial-up and VPN delegate ip communication with the Internet to a "server".

     + ?(lack reference)peers on VPN
       - if any communication between clients may happen, it should be after they dial in to the VPN server.
       - so potential arp attack might happen only if the clients are sharing an environment which is behind the VPN server(a shared lab, for example.) A client may send ARP through a shared lab machine. (detail?)
       - ? other angle on the VPN server?

* Book4_Chapter 03 The Address Resolution Protocol
  #+begin_quote
  In order for IP systems to communicate with each other, they must first be able to identify the hardware addresses of the other devices on the same network segment that the local device is on. This service is provided by the Address Resolution Protocol.
  #+end_quote

** the ARP standard
  #+begin_quote
  ARP packets communicate with the data-link layer directly, the same as IP packets. As such, ARP packets are completely separate from IP packets; they even have a different protocol ID of 0806, instead of 0800 as used with IP.
  #+end_quote

  + fields of an ARP packet
| field No. | field detail                                                    |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | the hardware address of the sources(who issued the ARP request) |
| 2         | the IP address of the source                                    |
| 3         | the hardware address of the destination                         |
| 4         | the IP address of the destination                               |
| 5         | the "message type" of this ARP packet                           |

  + a normal packet of ARP request :
  | field No. | field detail                         |
  |-----------+--------------------------------------|
  | 1         | the hardware address of the "sender" |
  | 2         | the IP address of the "sender"       |
  | 3         | 000...0                              |
  | 4         | the IP address of the "target"       |
  | 5         | "ARP request"                        |

  + a normal packet of ARP response:
| field No. | field detail                         |
|-----------+--------------------------------------|
| 1         | the hardware address of the "sender" |
| 2         | the IP address of the "sender"       |
| 3         | the hardware address of the "target" |
| 4         | the IP address of the "target"       |
| 5         | "ARP request"                        |
    
 + since ARP has no timeout, in some implementations when a new packet come to the queue and ask for an ARP request for an IP address, whose last ARP request is yet to be received, then the former packet which required the last ARP request may be dropped, depend on the implementation.
   #+begin_quote
   Many implementations only have room in the ARP lookup queue for a single packet for each of the hosts being queried. If an ARP request is not satisfied and another packet arrives from IP for the host being queried, then the first query will likely be aborted, and a second query will be issued. 
   #+end_quote

*** the ARP Cache
   #+begin_quote
   When the requesting system gets an ARP response, it will store the hardware and IP address pair of the requested device into a local cache. The next time that system needs to send data, it will check the local cache, and if an entry is found it will go ahead and use it, eliminating the need to broadcast another request.

   Likewise, the system that responded to the ARP broadcast will store the hardware and IP addresses of the system that sent the original broadcast. If it did not do so, it would have to issue an ARP broadcast to find out where to send the ARP response.

   Since all of the systems on the network will see the ARP broadcast, they could go ahead and capture the IP and hardware addresses of the sender, storing this information in their own caches. However, doing this might cause existing entries in the cache to be flushed (an especially problematic issue with systems that have small caches), so *only those systems who already have the sender’s IP address in their cache should update their entries*. Hosts that do not already have the device in their cache should ignore the broadcast.
   #+end_quote

   + potential issues:
     - cache size issue
     - cache timeout issue: If lifespan too long, old cache still in effect on some host, so that package of newly assigned ip went wrongly to old machines; Else, lifespan too short, the network is flooded with ARP broadcast.
     #+begin_quote
     RFC826: (Did not suggest a specific timeout value, but do state that) if a device sees an ARP packet whose IP address is already in the cache, then any timeout clocks for that entry should be reset. This helps the already-cached data to survive for as long as possible.

    #+begin_quote
In most situations, you do not need to use LIB to create your import library. When you link a program (either an executable file or a DLL) that contains exports, LINK automatically creates an import library that describes the exports. Later, when you link a program that references those exports, you specify the import library.

1. Call `LoadLibraryEx` or a similar function to load the DLL and obtain a module handle.

2. Call `GetProcAddress` to obtain a function pointer to each exported function that the application calls. Because applications call the DLL functions through a pointer, the compiler doesn't generate external references, so there's no need to link with an import library. However, you must have a typedef or using statement that defines the call signature of the exported functions that you call.

3. Call `FreeLibrary` when done with the DLL.

The Unicode standard permanently reserves these code point values for UTF-16 encoding of the high and low surrogates, and they will never be assigned a character, so there should be no reason to encode them.

** named pipe
   + info:
   #+begin_quote
   In computing, a named pipe (also known as a FIFO for its behavior) is an extension to the traditional pipe concept on Unix and Unix-like systems, and is one of the methods of inter-process communication (IPC). The concept is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is "unnamed" and lasts only as long as the process. *A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process*. It can be deleted if no longer used. Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.

   + N-type doping vs. P-type doping
     - In pure silicon, atoms shares the outter 4 electrons and form covalent bond.
     - N-type doping: replace an atom with e.g. Phosphorus
       - valence: (2,8,5), 1 free electron to donate
       - hence slightly *positive* after "donation"
     - P-type doping: replace an atom with e.g. Boron
       - valence: (2,3), 1 hole
       - hence slightly *negative* upon "acceptence"

    + turn on the word line.
    + the *differencial sence amplifier* detect the votage change hence knows the value of a word. The result is saved in a flip-flop circuit of the sence amplifer. The result then could be output through databuses.
    + hence a read operation of DRAM is destructive. It must be followed by an immediate write operation.
    + the voltage of bit lines are raised either to full operating voltage or dropped to the ground, depending to the read result, thus restores the data. 

    + an underlying problem:
      - a memory cell will leak charge to the bit line, even when the gate is closed. 
        - hence on regular basis, *refresh* operations is necessary. For every cells, approximately every 64 nano seconds
